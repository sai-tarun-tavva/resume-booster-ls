    "**Overall Impression:** The candidate possesses a strong technical background with extensive experience in Java full-stack development, encompassing a wide range of technologies and frameworks relevant to both front-end and back-end development. They have a demonstrable track record of working on large-scale projects across various domains.  While their skills align with some aspects of the Analyst I - Permitting role, a significant portion of their experience is more heavily focused on software development and less relevant to the permitting process. ",
    "**Desired Skills:**",
    "* **Strong written and verbal communication skills:** This aligns with the candidate's experience in producing documentation, providing detailed build logs, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.\n* **Strong analytical and organizational skills:** The candidate demonstrates these skills through their experience with data analysis, project management, and documentation. \n* **Knowledge of multiple MS Office applications:** The candidate mentions proficiency in Excel, Word, and Outlook.\n* **Ability to learn new software quickly:** This is a strong asset for the candidate, considering their experience with various tools and technologies.\n* **Ability to work efficiently on their own:**  The candidate's independent work experience on projects and handling production support demonstrates this ability.\n* **Great problem-solving skills:**  The candidate's experience in debugging, troubleshooting, and resolving technical issues points to strong problem-solving skills.\n* **Great organizational habits:** This aligns with the candidate's experience managing projects and maintaining detailed build logs.",
    "**Pre-requisite skills:**",
    "* **Understanding of Engineering & Construction methodologies:** This is a critical requirement for the role that the candidate's resume does not explicitly address.  \n* **Knowledge of permitting processes and procedures:** This is another critical requirement that the candidate's resume does not explicitly address.\n* **Telecom experience:** While the candidate has worked on projects in the logistics and insurance domain, experience in the telecom industry would be beneficial.\n* **GIS/mapping experience:** This is not mentioned in the candidate's resume, and while not a pre-requisite, would be a strong asset.",
    "**Recommendations:**",
    "* **The candidate's technical skills are impressive, but they lack the specific experience and knowledge required for a Permitting Analyst role.** The candidate should highlight any previous experience related to engineering, construction, or permitting processes, even if it was outside the telecom industry. \n* **The candidate should emphasize their strong communication, analytical, and organizational skills in their resume and cover letter.**  They should tailor their application to demonstrate how their skills translate to the specific requirements of the role.\n* **The candidate could benefit from taking courses or acquiring certifications related to permitting processes and procedures.** This would strengthen their candidacy and demonstrate their commitment to developing relevant skills. ",
    "**Conclusion:**",
    "While the candidate possesses strong technical skills, they might not be the ideal fit for this specific Analyst I - Permitting role due to the lack of relevant experience.  However, with some adjustments to their resume and targeted skill development, the candidate could potentially make themselves a more competitive applicant. \n",
